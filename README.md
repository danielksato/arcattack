Arc Attack live streaming midi project

To install, clone down the repo and then run ```npm install```. Please note the dependency on the local MIDIPlayer version; I've submitted a pull request to the upstream project but it has not yet been approved.

To run the POC code, run ```./midi``` from the main directory while listening for midi inputs, i.e. with Garageband (if you're on OS X).
